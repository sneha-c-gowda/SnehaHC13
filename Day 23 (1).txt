Git revert

Git revert is used to undo the committed changes. History will be tracked

Syntax:

git revert <commit_id>
it will revert the changes made in that commit id

git revert HEAD
it will revert the changes made in the recent/latest commit

git revert HEAD~1
it will revert the changes made in the last but one commit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Git reset

Git reset is used to undo the committed changes but history will not be tracked. The name itself indicates reset HEAD to the previous commits.

There are 3 types:
1) Mixed reset
	It is used to move the files from local git repo, back to the workspace
	Syntax:
		git reset --mixed <commit_id>
2) Soft reset
	It will remove the changes from the local git repo to the staging area. it removes the history.
	Syntax:
		git reset --soft <commit_id>
3) Hard reset
	There will be no clue that we have committed changes. It will remove history and changes from everywhere(git repo, staging area, workspace).
	Syntax:
		git reset --hard <commit_id>

Difference between git rebase and git merge
-> Merge just integrates the changes from one branch to another branch.
-> Rebase is nothing but a merge. One branch will get added to the tip of another branch
-> using git rebase we can squash multiple commits as a single commit and then we can merge the changes

git rebase

Syntax:
git rebase <branch_name>
it will merge the changes to the switched/current branch

git rebase -i HEAD~10
it will squash recent 10 commits as a single commit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

git pull

git pull will bring the changes from the remote repo to the local workspace and merges automatically to the respective branch.

Syntax:

git pull origin <branch_name>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git fetch

git fetch will bring the changes from the remote repo to the local workspace and stores it in a separate branch in local repo. We can review the changes and merge if required.

Syntax:

git fetch origin <branch_name>

NOTE:
git pull = git fetch + git merge



git stash

When we are working on one branch, if we get any critical bug which needs to be fixed on other branch. Before switching to the other branch, we need to stash incomplete work on the current branch. Once we fix the bug, we need to switch back to the current branch and pop the changes from the stash entry and continue with the work.
This will avoid committing the code on wrong branches

git add .
git stash 
it will move the changes to the stash entry

git stash list
it will list all the stashed entries.

git stash pop
it will retrieve the recent stash entry

git stash pop stash@{1}
it will retrieve the specific stash entry

git stash drop
it will delete the recent entry

git stash drop stash@{1}
it will delete the specific stash entry

git stash clear
it will delete all the stash entry.
